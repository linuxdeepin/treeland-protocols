      This interface is a manager for creating prelaunch splash screens.
      A prelaunch splash screen is a placeholder surface that is shown
      before an application's main window is mapped. This helps to improve
      the perceived startup time.

      It is particularly useful for application launchers to provide immediate
      feedback to the user.

        Creates a new prelaunch splash screen.

        The `app_id` is a string that identifies the application. The compositor
        will use this ID to match the splash screen with the actual application
        window when it appears. This matching mechanism should also work for
        XWayland windows.
