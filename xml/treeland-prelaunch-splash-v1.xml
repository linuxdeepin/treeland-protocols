      This interface is a manager for creating prelaunch splash screens.
      A prelaunch splash screen is a placeholder surface that is shown
      before an application's main window is mapped. This helps to improve
      the perceived startup time.

      It is particularly useful for application launchers to provide immediate
      feedback to the user.

        Creates a new prelaunch splash screen.

        Callers MUST provide a non-empty `sandboxEngineName` string which
        identifies the sandboxing/container.

        The `app_id` is a string that identifies the application. The compositor
        will use this ID together with `sandboxEngineName` to match the splash
        screen with the actual application window when it appears. This
        matching mechanism should also work for XWayland windows.

        If there is already an active (not-yet-completed) splash for the same
        `sandboxEngineName` and `app_id`, the compositor will silently ignore
        this request (no new splash will be created and no error is raised).
